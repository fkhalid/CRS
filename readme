Dependencies
------------

CRS depends on the following:

gcc (C compiler)
mpicc (MPI compiler, for running MPI code)
openMP libraries
numerical recipes (source code in C). http://www.nr.com/


Installation
------------

The following steps are needed to install CRS:

1. Set up paths to the numerical recipes source code 
   in the script config_numrec.sh (more details in the script itself), and run it.

2. Configure makefiles for compiling serial or mpi version by running the script switch_compiler.sh.
   For the serial version, type: switch_compiler.sh mpicc2gcc
   For the MPI version, type: switch_compiler.sh gcc2mpicc
  
3. Compile the code:
    cd Release
    make all
    cd ..

  This will create file run_crs or run_mpi_crs, depending on whether you are compiling the serial or parallel version.


Running the program
-------------------

1. Serial version:   

	Release/run_crs [options] name_of_input_file

   [options] are one of the following:
	-v --verbose: more output will be printed on the screen, including the name of each function producing output.
	-q, --quiet: screen messages are suppressed.


2. MPI version:

	mpirun -n N Release/run_mpi_crs [options] name_of_input_file

   where N is the desired no. of ranks.


A description of the input file can be found in the template file provided with the code.
