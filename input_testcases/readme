testA:	sources of uncertainty
testB:	input catalogs (e.g. mainshock missing or moved back)
testC:	Mc_source=2.0, different aftershock modes.
testD:	afterslip
testE:	background rate
testF:	fixedmec file
testG:	similar to testC, but without uncertainties. GT1 uses tapering.
testH:	similar to testG, but very simplified (few sources)
testI:	use of multiple slip models per event.
testL:	tests pscmp, fsp, farfalle formats; also multiple slip models with different no. of subfaults
testM:	multiple magnitude bins
