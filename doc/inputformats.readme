Below is a description of the formats of various input files.
They correspond to the following fields in the input file:

1.ForecastTemplate
2.InputBackgroundRateGrid
3.FixedMecFile*
4.IputCatalogFile*
5.InputBackgroundRateCatalog*
6.InputCatalogFocMecFile*

	*These fields are optional.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Forecast Template
--------------------

This file provides a template for the output forecast. There are two options:
(1) The input grid is made of equally spaced lon-lat-depth bins, arranged in a cuboid (the total no.of points is nlat x nlon x ndep).
    This format can be refined to obtain a higher resolution for Coulomb stress calculations (given in InputModelParameters file).
(2) The input grid is a cloud of points, with any arrangement. This format can not be refined internally.

In the first case, the format is the same as the CSEP forecast format:

	1.Minimum Longitude [deg]
	2.Maximum Longitude [deg]
	3.Minimum Latitude [deg]
	4.Maximum Latitude [deg]
	5.Depth Top [km]
	6.Depth Bottom [km]
	7.Minimum Magnitude
	8.Maximum Magnitude
	[9.Index of focal mechanisms catalog] *
	[10.Mask Bit] **

	* this column is only used if InputListCatalogFocMecFile is given in the input file. Otherwise it is optional.
	** the content of this lines doesn't matter for the template file, and the column is optional.

	Columns 1-6 indicate the edges of the bins.
	Column 9 is the index of the files listed in InputListCatalogFocMecFile. 
	Each of these files is a set of focal mechanisms that will be sampled for the grid point.

In the second case, a 5+column file should be provided, as follows:

        1.Longitude [deg]
        2.Latitude [deg]
        3.Depth km]
        4.Minimum Magnitude
        5.Maximum Magnitude
        [6.Index of focal mechanisms catalog] * 
	[7.Mask Bit] *

	* this column is only used if InputListCatalogFocMecFile is given in the input file. Otherwise it is optional.
	** the content of this lines doesn't matter for the template file, and the column is optional.

	Columns 1-3 indicate the calculation points.
	Note that the output seismicity rates/cumulative number of events are calculated at single points, and not adjusted for point density.


2. InputBackgroundRateGrid
--------------------------
File containing the gridded background seismicity.
Same format as ForecastTemplate, but column 9 or 6 contains the Seismicity Rate instead of the focal mechanism index, and it is not optional.


3. FixedMecFile
---------------
File containing gridded focal planes.
The file must have the same number of grid points as the ForecatTemplate file, and has 2 columns: 
strike [degress]	dip[degrees]


4.InputCatalogFile
5.InputBackgroundRateCatalog
--------------------------
Catalog files. ZMAP format:

1.Longitude [deg]
2.Latitude [deg]
3.Decimal year (e.g., 2005.5 for July 1st, 2005)
4.Month
5.Day
6.Magnitude
7.Depth [km]
8.Hour
9.Minute
10.Second
[11.Horizontal error]*
[12.Depth error]*
[13.Magnitude error]*

* optional columns. If not given, will use default values [TODO write where these are].

6.InputCatalogFocMecFile
----------------------
The catalog of focal mechanisms has the format of the GeoNet cvs files (but with tab/space separated columns).
following columns:

1.EVENT_ID	
2.Date (format: YYYYMMDDhhmmss, e.g. 20150930152322= 30th Sept. 2015 15:23:22).
3.Latitude
4.Longitude
5.strike1 (degrees)
6.dip1 (degrees)
7.rake1 (degrees)
8.strike2
9.dip2
10.rake2
11.Mw
12.depth
[Additional columns will be ignored]

strike1, dip1 will be used to create synthetic slip models for events which should be included as sources.
rakes are not used for receiver faults: Coulomb stresses are calculated in the slip direction on which the total shear stress is largest ('optimal rake').
This is hardwired but determined by a flag in the code ('optimal_rake' in src/general/clculateDCFSperturbed.c).
