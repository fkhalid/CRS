1. a readme.txt file (or equivalent) providing the name of the program, the title of the manuscript
along with the author details. This will assist in correctly assigning the program code and associated
files to the correct submission.
2. A user manual or instruction guide that provides information on how to use the program.
3. The source code for any programs that have been written.
4. Test data that can be used to assure that the program is working correctly. Test data should not
be overly large so that there are problems downloading the program code and data.
5. Output files should also be provided that will allow a user to check if a compiled program is
working properly.
6. Executable program code is not encouraged because of difficulty in transmitting .exe files past
Virus scanners and the limited life of executable code.
7. All files should be compressed into .zip or .gz format, which will then be placed on the
Computers& Geosciences FTP site for download once the manuscript has been accepted and published.
