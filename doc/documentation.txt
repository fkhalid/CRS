FixedMecFile contains focal mechanisms for the output grid. Format: strike dip.

Only sources of stress at t>tstartLL (InversionStartTime?) are included.




Background rate
---------------

The background rate is stored as two variables: 
(1) seismicity rate over the entire volume (a scalar);
(2) variations for each grid point (a vector);

The value of (1) can be inverted during the grid search, or it can be fixed.
This behavior is set in the section "Parameter Inversion" of the parameter file: if LLinversion=1, or if fixr0=1, it will be fixed; otherwise, it will be inverted for.

The fixed value will be r0 (given in parameter file), unless one of the following files is given in the input file: InputBackgroundRateGrid, InputBackgroundRateCatalog.
If InputBackgroundRateGrid is given, the background rate will be the rate given in the file (sum of 9th column); if InputBackgroundRateCatalog, the backgrounr rate will be estimated from the catalog, using a smoothing algorithm from Helmstetter [??].

Estimation of background rate from catalog
------------------------------------------

mention:
1. uniform vs non uniform grid.
   nonuniform grid uses no depth info (bg rate assumed to be uniform in depth), and not exact calculation of gaussian integral (only use center of cell instead).

2. GK algorithm, and rescaling of rate for events left after declustering.

Declustering only for events above Mag_main (set in parameter file)
