Priorities:
	provide version without NR.
	* DONE: work on afterslip structure.
	* DONE: make code work w/o catalog
	* DONE: allow non-seismic sources (e.g.dikes)
	* DONE allow for fixed vs optimal rake (hardwired, but ok).
	* DONE: allow for stopping stress (no splines)
	* DONE: allow for aseismic signal without coseismic one
	* DONE: test multiple stressing histories (merging etc.)
 	FIXME: splines give different results when using numerical recipes from outside.

Extra features:
	* allow externally calculated stress field
	* DONE linear time evolution between snapshots (no splines)
	* allow for simpler input files (with a default parameter file)
------------------------------------------------------------
extra project to put on github: model conversion scripts
				dist2fault
				XML format
				simple code to make grid file (could also include in CRS)
------------------------------------------------------------

* DONE change Afterslip to Aseismic (input files).
config_numrec only works from bash.
check reading uniform/nonuniform template (t160 vs t161).
* DONE To test: linear stressing history. Also should be allow to choose it.
* DONE copyright: check copyright for okada functions.
* DONE change name of Helmstetter function.
* DONE remove unused functions readRS, eispak, splines
* DONE headers for setup.c, defines, main.c
Implement output of multiple snapshots with MPI
get rid of printout.c files, tests, etc.
check fixmes, todos

Documentation:
------------- 

* grid refinement only with uniform grid (copy from paper).
* DONE merge example file and formats, and check both files.
check file called documentation.txt
change path of numerical recipes in makefiles to a dummy one.
add tutorial
add output files format, check none is missing.
remove left over comments in source code.
mention that printing out all snapshots is expensive in terms of memory, especially for small time steps and if internal geometry is refined.
Also not implemented in MPI yet.
* DONE state that opening is not available in fsp format.
* DONE explain that all aseismic events must have same general format (either all linear, or all splines, or all single snapshot).
* DONE first focal mechanism used to create synthetic slip model.
* DONE only uniform grid can be refined.
* DONE coseismic+afterslip geometry: less memory used if they are the same (could also put on paper).
* DONE fixed rec faults: will still optimize rake (flag, but hardwired).
* WILL NOT DOcatalog is optional but error is given if it is passed but no events are selected.
* WILL NOT DO document how eqkfm_co looks like for multiple slip models, and explain the mess with slipmodel_combinations loop.
* DONE explain limitations of non uniform grid for consideration of grid uncertainty.
* DONE explain: how IssueTime is used, and that it should be larger than the mainshock. 

how OOPS are calculated (stress field from eqks but not afterslip) and chosen (closest to regional mech.)

* DONE Explain cuts surf, and complications (consistency b/w models; all points should be above depth).
* DONE say somewhere that fault resolution in model par. file only applies to synthetic models (Wells Coppersmith), as it affects tapering.
list all units
* WILL NOT DO describe: how is a slip model represented; also: list of slip models and multiple slip models (and list of slip models with multiple slip models) continuos (in time) vs discrete stress fields are treated.
*WILL NOT DO could change representation of slip models so that instead of using multiple subfaults, each patch is allowed to have itw ons orientation; each earthquake will be a single element in eqkfm_co -> okadaCoeff_mpi would speed up computation for models with many single patches.
* WILL NOT DO allow for easier grid (inside code).
* DONE Say which part of the code are by other people!! (DC3D + Bach)

cmbmap_post is output from forecast even if it occurs before -> change this?

* WILL NOT DO Allow events to be selected even if they occur before InversionStartDate (use DataStartDate ?)
* DONE checked afterslip/coseismic slip geometry agree. Set cuts_surf for afterslip from coseismic slip.

* WILL NOT DO May also want to change cut_surf in code (since current version uses different depths for each event -> not consistent).
* DONE urf for multiple slip models=? Also: explain it in the input file

may want to avoid using all_gammas if nsur is very high (not enough memory).

* DONE: multiple afterslips not supported. Also: no afterslip with different input slip models.
* DONE: reorganize parameters file. Also change aftershock flags.
* WILL NOT DO: add headers to output files.
* DONE allow for case w/o slip models (no files passed at al -> make InputListSlipModels optional) and w/o catalog.
* DONE test a case w/o events.
* DONE tests with different continuous stresses.
give error if not enough memory available
* DONE: allow foreshocks

think about formats for:
* DONE - grid file
* DONE - foc mec file (for grid)
* DONE - add mask column for forecast
- slip model: don't need entire file (pscmp)

* DONE complain if catalog not chronological.
check: (*eqfm_comb)[c3].selpoints=all_pts; should go before:if(which_slipmod[i]==-1) { in read_eqkfm.c?
* DONE FIXME refined files are wrong.
* DONE: IssueDate has to appear before ForecastStartDate, EndDate -> should make it clear or fix it.
* DONE fix floating point problem when Nsur<Nslipmodels.
* DONE: uniform formats between slip models and master file.
* DONE/WILL NOT DO: additional log output (eg list catalogs etc?)
* DONE: write small description inside each file.
* DONE/WILL NOT DO: Reorganize a bit across files.
* DONE: Make sure each function is attributed to right person.
* WILL NOT DO Output information about tapering.
* WILL NOT DO why need square patches?
fix "\n" in log file.

* DONE create parameter InversionStartDate (instead of passing it from parameter file).
* DONE only output this once per (Asig, ta) point: *Warning: gamma==Inf, must choose larger Asig!*

need to check if char[X] variables are large enough!!
compilation problems with recent gcc?
* DONE link nrutil separately?
valgrind to check memory leaks 

* DONE check consistency of r0, crst.r0 (calculations vs. output). (also: think about calculation of LL in the case in which cat.Mc != crst....)
* DONE check indices of times2, splines etc.
* WILL NOT DO make sure coordinates are consistens across files (eg template, slip model, catalog etc).
* DONE [removed tapering] allow tapering to be set from the outside (only for single subfault events?).
* DONE don't hardwire crst.mu=26624.
* DONE Easier output to flog (write function for it).

//---------------simplifications to consider-----------------------//

* WILL NOT DO no splines
* DONE no search for older mainshock
* DONE no MC for aftershocks (since they are epistemic).
avoid adjusting position of patches
* WILL NOT DO no print out LLevents (and forecast LL)
* DONE no print out refined

//----------------------other things-------------------------------//

* DONE [decided not to do] non stationary starting background rate?
* DONE [no refined grid anymore] flag printref in CRSforecast (to print out refined grid).
* DONE print out cmb for afterslip
* DONE check out numerical recipes stuff;
* DONE copyright etc.
