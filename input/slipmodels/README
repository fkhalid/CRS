This directory contains the slip distributions we have obtained so far for
the Canterbury earthquake sequence. This includes slip distributions for
the following events:

Sept., 2011 Darfield event
Feb., 2011 Christchurch event
June, 2011 Christchurch event
Dec., 2011 Pegasus Bay events (both M5.8 and M6.0)

The slip distributions were obtained by John Beavan and by Caroline Holden
at various times following each event. The slip distributions are in the 
format used by the Farfalle Coulomb stress code. An example top-level
Farfalle file is included in the top-level of this directory. Note that the
files that include slip distributions are included in this file.
