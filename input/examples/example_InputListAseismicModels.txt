# This file lists the slip models (or tensile sources) for aseismic events, and describes their temporal evolution.
# It has the following format:
# 1. number of events
# 2. This line can have 3 alternatives:
# 	  A): format	lin
# 	  B): format 	log 	T0
#	  C): format 	splines
#	format is the format of the slip models (pscmp, fsp, farfalle)
#	NOTE: the model has a tensile component the format "pscmp" must be used.
#   	if the second argument is "lin", will assume linear evolution of stress between time steps.
#	if the second argument is "log", it will use a function of the form: s(t)= C*log(1+t/T0), where T is given and C is a normalizing constant. A single snapshot must be given.
#	if the second argument is "splines", it will perform splines interpolation between snapshots. Multiple snapshots must be provided.
# 3. reference time for ev. 1		no. of snapshots models (lines to read) until next event
# 4. time	path_to_file 
# 5. time	path_to_file
# ...
# reference time for ev. 2              no. of snapshots models (lines to read) until next event
#
# time if the time (days) to which each files refers, from the reference time for that event.
# Note that less memory/CPU time will be used if these models have the same geometry as the coseismic slip model at the corresponding time.
